## Overview  
Manually dealing cards before a card game can be tedious and subject to human error. This problem is mitigated by automating the dealing process with a robot. Furthermore, removing the need for a person to deal cards provides the players a break between games.
The card-dealing robot deals playing cards to a variable number of players and number of cards per player, providing sufficient customization to be able to deal cards for a variety of games and situations. In addition, the robot includes three pre-programmed deal patterns which correspond to three common card games, namely Poker, President, and Go Fish, and are activated using the colour sensor. This saves the user the hassle of manually inputting all the parameters every time they want to play those games. Video Demenstration

Our software takes manual input through the EV3 interface and uses the information to move the robot to different positions on a table and deal cards for specific games. The colour sensor mode has simplified user inputs that makes the robot deal cards for certain games.
The main function, as shown in Figure 2, loops a main menu, and allows the user to select between Manual and Colour Mode as many times as they need, until the user presses the button to quit the program.
