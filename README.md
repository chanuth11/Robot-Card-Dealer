## Overview
Manually dealing cards before a card game can be tedious and subject to human error. This problem is mitigated by automating the dealing process with a robot. Furthermore, removing the need for a person to deal cards provides the players a break between games.
The card-dealing robot deals playing cards to a variable number of players and number of cards per player, providing sufficient customization to be able to deal cards for a variety of games and situations. In addition, the robot includes three pre-programmed deal patterns which correspond to three common card games, namely Poker, President, and Go Fish, and are activated using the colour sensor. This saves the user the hassle of manually inputting all the parameters every time they want to play those games. Video Demenstration
